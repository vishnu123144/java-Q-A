our prog code is not responsible


being a prog if error is caused then prog not handle it
Errors are caused due to lack of system resource
may be memory problem, hardware problem
like stackoverflow error

A java.lang.OutOfMemoryError is a runtime error in Java which occurs when the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) is unable to allocate an object due to insufficient space in the Java heap. The Java Garbage Collector (GC) cannot free up the space required for a new object, which causes a java.lang.OutOfMemoryError

stackoverflowerror
java.lang.StackOverflowError occurs when the application stack continues to grow until it reaches the maximum limit
