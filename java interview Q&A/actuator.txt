Spring boot actuator

Spring Boot Actuator is a sub-project of the Spring Boot Framework. 
It uses HTTP endpoints to expose operational information about any running application.
It includes a number of additional features that help us to monitor and manage the Spring Boot application. 

If we want to get production-ready features in an application, we should use the Spring Boot actuator.

There are three main features of Spring Boot Actuator:

Endpoints
Metrics
Audit
