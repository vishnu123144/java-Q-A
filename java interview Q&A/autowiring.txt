Autowiring - 

Autowiring feature of spring framework enables you to inject the object dependency implicitly. It internally uses setter or constructor injection.


Autowiring Modes
Spring supports the following autowiring modes:

no: Itâ€™s the default autowiring mode. It means no autowiring.
byName: The byName mode injects the object dependency according to name of the bean. In such case, property name and bean name should be same. It internally calls setter method.
byType: The byType mode injects the object dependency according to type. So it can have different property name and bean name. It internally calls setter method.
constructor: The constructor mode injects the dependency by calling the constructor of the class. It calls the constructor having large number of parameters.
autodetect: In this mode, Spring first tries to autowire by constructor. If this fails, it tries to autowire by using byType.
