Internal Working of linked List
List<integer> list = new LinkedList<Integer>();

it created an doubly linked list internally

internally a method node() 

Node is created which has 3 parts
first part is stored previous element data
second part store data element 
third part store next element

if adding a elements using addFirst, addLast method then internally linked list uses linkFirst and linkLast methods the reference of that method will be first() and last()

list.add(10)
list.add(35)
list.add(78)

if we want to delete 35 element
list.remove(1)
or
list.remove(new Integer(35));

then Node of 35 will be remvoed and automatically Node 10 point to next adress of Node 78
