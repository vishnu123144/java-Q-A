Try with resources -
Try-with-resources statement is a try statement that declares one or more resources in it. A resource is an object that must be closed once your program is done using it. For example, a File resource or a Socket connection resource.  
it was introduced in 1.7

The try-with-resources statement ensures that each resource is closed at the end of the statement execution.


it is automatically closed all the resource by using
autocloseable interface close()

advantage is 
whatever the resources we are defining then no need to explicitly close the resources
automatically it closes the resource

length of the code is less

complexity of the code improved

no need for finally block

there is no need for finally()
