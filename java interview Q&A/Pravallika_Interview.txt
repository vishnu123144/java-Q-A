1) what is partitioning in sql

Assume that we have a table and it grows day by day. In this case, the table can cause some problems which need to be solved 

Maintain this table. It will take a long time and consume more resources (CPU, IO etc.).
Back up.
Lock problems.

so we can resolve this problmes by using table partitioning

 Table partitioning is a way to divide a large table into smaller, more manageable parts without having to create separate tables for each part. Data in a partitioned table is physically stored in groups of rows called partitions and each partition can be accessed and maintained separately

advantage - 
The relative speedup of queries
Faster data load
Faster deletion of old data
Faster archival of rarely used or old data

Regarding the actual implementation, the main idea behind table partitioning is to create a “parent” table and several “children” tables responsible for holding the data. The number of children is not necessarily constant and can grow as time goes by.

Vertical Partitioning splits the table into columns.
As the name suggests vertical partitioning is nothing but to split tables vertically. Let me give you an example. Consider an employee table having employee name, employee address, employee city, employee id, employee number, and employee salary. Now consider a big organization where there are lots of employees, such as BANKS. Here HR needs to analyze employee data and generate reports on daily basis. Employee address and employee city are not required -- those are less required fields so you can put that data in one part. Employee ID, number, name, and salary --  these columns are used constantly to fetch reports so you can split these columns in another chunk .

Horizontal Partitioning splits the table into rows.
As the name says horizontal partitioning divides a table with the same number of columns with fewer rows . This scenario is possible from From date – To Date , this Year to that year and so on. 

Create Table partition

Create a table and populate the data first
Create the partition Function
Creation the partition Scheme
Create Clustered index on the table using the partition scheme to move the datas to the partitions

CREATE PARTITION FUNCTION val_partition_function (INT) 
AS RANGE RIGHT FOR VALUES('4000','8000') 

CREATE PARTITION SCHEME val_partition_scheme
AS PARTITION val_partition_function TO (FG1,FG2,FG3)

2) query to get the list of employees whose salary is greater than 20000
	output should be in the form of arraylist (not individual rows) 
	Given hint-> using GroupBy

3) exception hierarchy

4) why string is immutable

The String is immutable in Java because of the security, synchronization and concurrency, caching, and class loading. The reason of making string final is to destroy the immutability and to not allow others to extend it.
String object is given as immutable for storing this object as a key in collection map object
map type of object is hashtable to store key as a string inside a map object, so string is given as immutable

Security - The String is widely used in Java applications to store sensitive pieces of information like usernames, passwords, connection URLs, network connections, etc. It's also used extensively by JVM class loaders while loading classes.

Syncronization and concurrency - Being immutable automatically makes the String thread safe since they won't be changed when accessed from multiple threads.

Hashcode Caching - Since String objects are abundantly used as a data structure, they are also widely used in hash implementations like HashMap, HashTable, HashSet, etc. When operating upon these hash implementations, hashCode() method is called quite frequently for bucketing.

Performance - As we saw previously, String pool exists because Strings are immutable. In turn, it enhances the performance by saving heap memory and faster access of hash implementations when operated with Strings.

5) Integer is immutable or Mutable

Integer and all primitive wrapper classes is immutable

6) self join ?

A self join is a join in which a table is joined with itself, specially when the table has a foreign key which references its own Primary key

for example a employee table has 2 columns emplid and managerid 
so employee is also an manager

Internally sql server creates an virtually copy of an table and creates relation with each other


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

7) can self join be implemented with two different tables having same data?

Yes, It may be virtually copied table created internally by sql server or Created by any user

8) application server,web server

A web server accepts and fulfills requests from clients for static content (i.e., HTML pages, files, images, and videos) from a website. Web servers handle HTTP requests and responses only.

An application server exposes business logic to the clients, which generates dynamic content. It is a software framework that transforms data to provide the specialized functionality offered by a business, service, or application.

Web server encompasses web container only.
While application server encompasses Web container as well as EJB container.

Web server consumes or utilizes less resources.
While application server utilize more resources.

In web servers, multithreading is not supported.
While in application server, multithreading is supported.

Web server’s capacity is lower than application server.
While application server’s capacity is higher than web server.

In web server, HTTP protocols are used.
While in this, GUI as well as HTTP and RPC/RMI protocols are used.

9) programme to reverse the string without using char array

static String reverse(String str){
String revString = "";
for(int i=str.length(); i>0; --i){
revString = revString + str.charAt(i-1);
}

return revString;
}


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

10) how many objects wil get formed on reversing the string s="123456" ?

6
