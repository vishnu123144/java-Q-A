Class Loaders

ClassLoader in Java is called by the Java Runtime Environment to dynamically load the classes whenever required by the application in the Java Virtual Machine. ClassLoaders are a part of the Java Runtime Environment, 

it is an abstract class.

It is a subsystem of JVM which is used to load class files. It is mainly responsible for three activities.

Loading
Linking
Initialization


ClassLoader loads a class by using getClassLoader() method . 
All classes are loaded based on their names and if any of these classes are not found then it returns a NoClassDefFoundError or ClassNotFoundException.


Bootstrap Class loader - It loads standard JDK class files from rt.jar and other core classes. It is a parent of all class loaders.

Extension Class loader - It delegates class loading request to its parent. If the loading of a class is unsuccessful, it loads classes from jre/lib/ext directory

System class loader - It loads application specific classes from the CLASSPATH environment variable. It can be set by a programmer to its system environment or classpath command line options.
