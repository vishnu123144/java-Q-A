Index - 
Indexes are special lookup tables that the database search engine can use to speed up data retrieval. Simply put, an index is a pointer to data in a table. An index in a database is very similar to an index in the back of a book.

For example, if you want to reference all pages in a book that discusses a certain topic, you first refer to the index, which lists all the topics alphabetically and are then referred to one or more specific page numbers.

An index helps to speed up SELECT queries and WHERE clauses, but it slows down data input, with the UPDATE and the INSERT statements. 
Indexes can be created or dropped with no effect on the data.

Creating an index involves the CREATE INDEX statement, which allows you to name the index, to specify the table and which column or columns to index, and to indicate whether the index is in an ascending or descending order.

3 Types of indexes

a) Single-Column Indexes or clustered index - Each table has only one clustered index, by default automatically sql created primary key as clustered key. but we can customized to create clustered index to any column

CREATE INDEX index_name
ON table_name (column_name);

CREATE INDEX idx_lastname
ON Persons (LastName);


b) Composite Indexes or non - clustered index - A composite index is an index on two or more columns of a table.

c) unique index - Unique indexes are used not only for performance, but also for data integrity. A unique index does not allow any duplicate values to be inserted into the table

CREATE UNIQUE INDEX index_name
on table_name (column_name);

DROP INDEX index_name;
