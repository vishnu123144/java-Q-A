Key - Key is an attribute or set of attribute that uniquely identifies any record from the table
---------------------------------------------------------

Types of Keys
Super Key
Candidate Key
Primary Key
Alternate key
Foreign Key
Composite Key

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1) Super Key - A super key is a set of one or more attributes (columns), which can uniquely identify a row in a table.
ex {empId, aadhar}, {Name, empId}, {empId}
it is a superset of candidate key
a table can have many super keys

2) Candidate Key - CANDIDATE KEY in SQL is a set of attributes that uniquely identify tuples in a table. Candidate Key is a super key with no repeated attributes. The Primary key should be selected from the candidate keys. Every table must have at least a single candidate key. A table can have multiple candidate keys but only a single primary key.


It must contain unique values
Candidate key in SQL may have multiple attributes
Must not contain null values
It should contain minimum fields to ensure uniqueness
Uniquely identify each record in a table

3)Primary Key - Primary key is one of the candidate key chosen by the database designer to uniquely identify the records in a table
the values can never be NULL
the values must always be unique(not duplicate)
the values must be assigned when inserting a record
The value in a primary key column can never be modified or updated if any foreign key refers to that primary key

4) Alternate keys - Out of all candidate keys, Only one gets selected as primary key, remaining keys are knows as alternate keys.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

5) Foreign Key - 
A foreign key is 
a key used to link two tables together
A FOREIGN KEY is a field (or collection of fields) in one table, that refers to the PRIMARY KEY in another table.
the purpose of foreign key is to ensure or maintain referential integrity of the data
The table with the foreign key is called the child table, and the table with the primary key is called the referenced or parent table.

Foreign key references the primary key of the table
Foreign key can take only those values which are present in the primary key of the references relation
Foreign key may have a name other than that of a primary key
Foreign key can take null value
There is no restruction on a foreing key to be unique

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

6) Composite Key - COMPOSITE KEY is a combination of two or more columns that uniquely identify rows in a table.
It is also known as compound key
A composite key can also be made by the combination of more than one candidate key.
A composite key cannot be null.
